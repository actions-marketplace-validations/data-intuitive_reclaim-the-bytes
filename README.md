# Reclaim The Bytes

Remove unused software to reclaim disk space.

The inspiration for this action:

- [easimon/maximize-build-space](https://github.com/easimon/maximize-build-space)
- [ThewApp/free-actions](https://github.com/ThewApp/free-actions)

**Caveat:** Removal of unnecessary software is implemented by `rm -rf`
on specific folders, not by using a package manager or anything
sophisticated. While this is quick and easy, it might delete
dependencies that are required by your job and so break your build
(e.g.Â because your build job uses a .NET based tool and you removed the
required runtime). Please verify which software may or may not be
removed for your specific use case.

## Usage
